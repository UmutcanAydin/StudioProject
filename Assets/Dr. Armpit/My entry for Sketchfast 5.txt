This was my entry for Sketchfast 5 (72 hours time to create a Pixar-like monster)

Contest: http://blog.sketchfab.com/post/52953410943/sketchfast-5-monsters-university

Here is my Monster, i call it Prof. Dr. Armpit (I'm not really good at naming)

It was fun and I improved my sculpting skills at Dynamic Topology Sculpting.
Dynamic Topology is awesome to baking textures :)

For the facerig i used a lattice in combination with the armature.
After the contest I've improved the rig and for a easy control i added some Custom Bone Shapes.
